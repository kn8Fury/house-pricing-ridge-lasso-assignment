# House Price prediction using Linear, Ridge and Lasso Regression

A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price. For the same purpose, the company has collected a data set from the sale of houses in Australia.

The company is looking at prospective properties to buy to enter the market. You are required to build a regression model using regularisation in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not.

## General Information

Learning all the training data leads to over-fitting and the resulting model will perform poorly on unseen data. To make the model more robust and generalized, a hyper-parameter is used to penalize the number of features. By finding the optimal value of this hyper-parameter, we can learn the underlying patterns in the data without over-fitting.

The company, Surprise Housing wants to know:
- Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house, and
- How well those variables describe the price of a house.

Also, determine the optimal value of lambda for ridge and lasso regression.

The date used in for this assignment is in the dataset branch
